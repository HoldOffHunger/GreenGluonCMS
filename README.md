# GreenGluonCMS
PHP/MySQL Content Management System.

## Technology Used
- PHP
- MySQL
- Google Oauth API
- Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) API

## Big Sample Sites Using This Code
- [EarthFluent.com: Teaching Languages to the World](http://www.earthfluent.com/)

   Provides language lessons and quizzing for English speakers wishing to learn one of 12 available languages.  This uses Chrome-only's voiceSynthesizer to accurately reproduce accent and pronunciation, whether you are studying French or Korean.  Also, Gooogle CSE (Custom Search Engine) is used here, using the image search to generate the images used to identify words in the lessons and quizzes.

- [WordWeight.com: Weighing Your Words](http://www.wordweight.com/)

   This site is handling 100,000 different URL queries (i.e., site.com/word/), which then serves up results from a dictionary that was parsed into a MySQL DB.

- [CopyLeftLicense.com: Every Open Source License](http://www.copyleftlicense.com/)

    This site provides a basic way to upload and sort content that may then be liked, commented on, tagged, reposted on 40 different social media networks, downloaded in 18 different formats, listened to using a built-in audio player, and properly crawled by websites using the specifications for sitemap xml files and robots txt files.
