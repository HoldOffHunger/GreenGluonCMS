The original Excelsior Surgical Society met for the first time in 1945 at the end of World War II at the Excelsior Hotel in Rome. The Society consisted of surgeons who had been deployed and they met yearly to discuss their experiences until the Society was retired in the 1980s. The meeting consisted of updates from the Surgical Consultants to the Surgeon Generals of the Army Navy and Air Force as well as invited lectures and research presentations by surgical residents from military training programs. The Excelsior Surgical Society is now formalized and will be a permanent entity at the annual ACS meeting. The Society is currently developing a set of bylaws and is in the process of electing leaders and defining membership. At the  Clinical Congress 2016 meeting there will be a call for abstracts from military residents fellows and junior faculty expanding to all areas of surgery in addition to trauma. There are plans to hold a round-table discussion to include the Surgical Advisors to the Surgeons Generals on the topic of sustaining surgical skills in the military after completion of residency/fellowship training		Marriott Marquis Washington DC	Marquis Ballroom Salon 5	Y	2016_ps
PS002	13437	Resident and Associate Society Symposium Exploring the Limits of Surgeon Disclosure:  Where are the Boundaries?	10/16/2016	3:00 PM	5:30 PM	2.5	N	Surgical care has evolved tremendously over the past few decades.  Some of the most striking changes have occurred within the patient-doctor relationship.  In the current environment of increasing health consumerism surgical paternalism has been rejected and the traditional boundaries of surgeon-to-patient disclosure have been questioned.  Much attention has been directed to the surgeons perioperative fatigue the practice of concurrent surgery and the degree of trainee involvement in surgical cases.  Some patient advocates and physicians insist that patients be specifically informed of such details while many in the surgical community emphasize that the degree of disclosure should be subject to the attending surgeons professionalism and judgment. Should mandatory preoperative disclosure of details such as a surgeons sleep habits be required? Should family stressors also be disclosed?  If so what information is considered relevant to the procedure versus personal and private? Or should the boundaries of such disclosure be determined by the operating surgeons professional assessment and judgment?  These questions will be featured and debated at the 2016 RAS-ACS Symposium in Washington.		Washington DC Convention Center	145	N	2016_ps

SSC10	12797	Endovascular Approaches to Hemorrhage Control and Resuscitation - Integrating BEST and ESTARS	10/18/2016	9:00 AM	4:30 PM	6	N	This course is the integration of two published training courses Basic Endovascular Skills for Trauma (BEST) and Endovascular Skills for Trauma and Resuscitative Surgery (ESTARS) designed to familiarize physicians with the basic endovascular techniques required to perform the maneuver referred to as resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA).  Preclinical translational investigations have noted the physiologic benefits of REBOA for abdominal and pelvic hemorrhage and shock. Recent case reports and multi-institutional trials have demonstrated safe and effective control of hemorrhage using REBOA in patients with life-threatening hemorrhage below the diaphragm. This skill set can be performed safely in the resuscitation suite using X-ray or in the operating room using fluoroscopy. The advent of the hybrid operating room coupled with the potential benefits of endovascular techniques in the setting of trauma will likely result in an increasing number of patients being diagnosed and treated with catheter-based interventions. Basic pelvic angiography will be also discussed and demonstrated as a potential bridge from REBOA to definitive hemorrhage control.		Washington DC Convention Center	Salon I	Y	2016_ssc

TH11	13469	Appendectomy vs. Antibiotics-The First American Randomized Trial	10/19/2016	7:00 AM	7:45 AM	0	N	For the past 130 years appendectomy has been the standard treatment for appendicitis. Recent studies from Europe have challenged the notion that surgery is the best option showing that antibiotics alone can treat appendicitis without a need for appendectomy in as many as 3 out of 4 patients and without safety issues for up to one year of follow up.  Despite these results it remains to be determined if the antibiotic strategy is as good as an appendectomy for the outcomes that most patients care about.  The PCORI-funded Comparison of Outcomes of Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial will be the first American and largest-ever randomized trial of the issue and its results should help surgeons and patients make more informed healthcare decisions		Washington DC Convention Center	207B	N	2016_th

TH14	13243	How to set up a Lung Cancer Screening Program at Your Institution	10/20/2016	7:00 AM	7:45 AM	0	N	Lung cancer screening with low dose CT scans has a very clear impact on disease specific mortality.  The process of setting up a screening program has some very specific needs including well-defined process requirements needed for Medicare reimbursement.  In addition unlike breast or prostate screening lung cancer screening will require a method for disposition of patients who have unrelated diagnoses identified during the screening process.  The above issues as well as the basic mechanics of setting up the program will be reviewed in this session.    CME is not given for attendance at Town Hall Meetings.  No formal presentations are made neither is audience response equipment provided.		Washington DC Convention Center	202 B		2016_th
TH15	13245	Autonomy: The Secret Recipe for Surgical Education	10/20/2016	7:00 AM	7:45 AM	0	N	The importance of autonomy in the latter parts of surgical training has never been more evident.  The lack of autonomy is perhaps one of the most concerning aspects of today's surgical education.  This town hall will discuss the latest proposed changes to help improve autonomy in training.  Further it will define models that will help foster autonomy within the current medical-legal environment.    CME is not given for attendance at Town Hall Meetings.

TH18	13229	A New Era for Global Surgery	10/20/2016	7:00 AM	7:45 AM	0	N	The initiatives by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by several surgical associations including the ACS have stressed the fact that surgery is a main part of global humanitarian care as basic surgical procedures (appendectomy cholecystectomy C-section etc. ) are a necessity and a way to avoid unnecessary deaths rather than a luxury. The ACS with its global reach should identify ways to take an active lead in this effort by (the following are examples): a) creating educational skill-based modules that can be used in underserved areas/countries b) identifying possible cooperations with other associations such as the WHO or the Medecins Sans Frontiers.  As part of this Town Hall international members of the ACS can present their experiences and offer valuable insights.    CME is not given for attendance at Town Hall Meetings.

TH19	13503	Use and Abuse of Opioids in the Surgical Practice	10/18/2016	7:00 AM	7:45 AM	0	N	Unintentional death from opioid overdose is increasingly common.  More than 165 000 people died from opioid overdoses from 1999-2014.  As a result there is increasing scrutiny of opioid prescriptions by physicians.  Knowledge and skill in pain management is a core competency for all surgeons since adequate pain control is central to good patient care.  However there is increasing tension between the need to balance adequate pain control while guarding against inappropriate opioid use and abuse.  The purpose of this town hall discussion is to provide a venue for surgeons to discuss current challenges and approaches to adequately meeting the need for adequate pain control in their patients while ensuring they are in compliance with current prescribing regulations.
